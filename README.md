# Fetch SDET Homework Assignment
This is a take home assignment for a fetch SDET role. I wrote my solution to this in cypress/js.

## Installation Instructions
To install Cypress, follow the instructions here `https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements`, or look below.

**Note:** You must first have Node.js installed. Instructions can be found here `https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs`

- After installing node.js and cloning the repo, cd into the repo and run `npm install cypress --save-dev` to install cypress.
- Then, run `npx cypress open` to get the gui version of cypress to load, and run the test as needed.
